Place your map image(s) in this folder.

Required filename for the included `MapWithSelector` component:

- `map.png` -> referenced as `/images/map.png`

Example (repo-relative): `frontend-user/public/images/map.png`

If you want to use a different file name, update `src/components/organisms/MapWithSelector.tsx` to point to the correct path.
